Module "Bit1"      (component BitIO)
   - Bit1_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - Bit1_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or 
                a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bit1_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - Bit1_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "DA1"       (component DAC_LDD)
   - DA1_Init -Initializes the device according to design-time configuration properties. Allocates memory for the device data 
                structure.   If the <Enable in init. code> is set to "yes" then the device is also enabled (see the description 
                of the Enable method).  This method can be called only once. Before the second call of Init the Deinit method 
                must be called first. If DMA service is enabled this method also initializes inherited DMA Transfer component.
   - DA1_SetValue -Sets DAC output voltage according to specified value.  Input data format is specified by <Data mode> 
                property settings. If selected formatting is not native for DAC device which is used then any necessary 
                transformations (e.g. shifting) are done._/Note: This method is available only if Data buffer is disabled./_

Module "PIT"       (component Init_PIT_VAR0)
   - PIT_Init -This method initializes registers of the PIT module according to the Peripheral Initialization settings. Call 
                this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; see 
                "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "EInt1"     (component ExtInt)
   - EInt1_GetVal -Returns the actual value of the input pin of the component.

Module "Cpu"       (component MKL25Z128LK4)
